# <img src="docs/user_guide_src/merlin_logo.png" alt="logo" width="85"/> Merlin: HugeCTR #
[![v22](docs/user_guide_src/version.JPG)](docs/hugectr_user_guide.md#newly-added-features-in-version-22)

HugeCTR is a recommender specific framework which is capable of distributed training across multiple GPUs and nodes for Click-Through-Rate (CTR) estimation.
It is a component of [**NVIDIA Merlin**](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-merlin#getstarted),
which is an open beta framework accelerating the entire pipeline from data ingestion and training to deploying GPU-accelerated recommender systems.

Design Goals:
* Fast: it's a speed-of-light CTR training framework;
* Dedicated: we consider everything you need in CTR training;
* Easy: you can start your work now, no matter if you are a data scientist, a learner, or a developer.

## Version 2.2.1
HugeCTR version 2.2.1 is a minor update to v2.2, which includes the Parquet data support, the sample preprocessing script rewritten in nvTabular, etc. Find the full list of changes [**here**](docs/hugectr_user_guide.md#whats-new-in-version-221).

## Version 2.2
In HugeCTR version 2.2, we add [**the new features**](docs/hugectr_user_guide.md#whats-new-in-version-22) like *full fp16 pipeline*, *algorithm search*, *AUC calculation*, etc, 
whilst enabling the support of the world's most advanced accelerator, NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and the modern models such as *Wide and Deep*, *Deep Cross Network*, *DeepFM*, *Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM)*.
This document describes how to set up the environment and run HugeCTR.
For more details such as HugeCTR architecture and supported features, please refer to [**HugeCTR User Guide**](docs/hugectr_user_guide.md) and [**Questions and Answers**](docs/QAList.md) in directory `docs/`

## Getting Started with NGC
A production docker image of HugeCTR is available in the NVIDIA container repository at the following location: https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:hugectr.

You can pull and launch the container using the following command:
```shell
docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) nvcr.io/nvidia/hugectr:v2.2.1 bash
```
If you are running on a docker version 19+, change `--runtime=nvidia` to `--gpus all`.

This image contains the executable files only enough for production use cases. For the full installation, please refer to [the quick start section](quick-start).

## Quick Start

### 1. Download Repository ###
You can download the HugeCTR repository and the third party modules which it relies upon:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/HugeCTR.git
cd HugeCTR
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
###  2. Build Docker Image and HugeCTR ###
Inside the HugeCTR directory, build a docker image:
```shell
# It may take a long time to download and build all the dependencies.
docker build -t hugectr:devel -f ./tools/dockerfiles/dev.a100.Dockerfile . #docker support A100. To use Tensorflow please use dev.tf.Dockerfile instead.
```
If you have Docker 19.03 or later, run the container with the following command: 
```shell
docker run --gpus all --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/hugectr -w /hugectr hugectr:devel bash
```
Otherwise, run the container with the following command: 
```shell
docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/hugectr -w /hugectr hugectr:devel bash
```


Then build HugeCTR with the build type and compute capability specified. Please see [**Build Options**](#build-options) for more details.

First, make a build directory and get inside it:
```shell
mkdir -p build
cd build
```
If your target graphic card is NVIDIA A100, run the following command. If you are using NVIDIA V100 or NVIDIA T4, change `-DSM=80` to `-DSM=70` or `-DSM=75`.
```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSM=80 .. # Target is NVIDIA A100
```
Finally build it. HugeCTR executable file and unit tests are located inside `build/bin`.
```shell
make -j
```

###  3. Download and Preprocess Dataset ###
Letâ€™s download [the Kaggle Display Advertising Challenge Dataset](http://labs.criteo.com/2014/02/kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset) to `$HugeCTR/tools/criteo_script/` and preprocess it to train [the Deep & Cross Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05123.pdf) (DCN) example:
```shell
cd ../../tools/criteo_script/ # assume that the downloaded dataset is here
bash preprocess.sh dcn 1 0
```

Alternatively you can generate a synthetic dataset:
```shell
cd /hugectr/build
mkdir dataset_dir
bin/data_generator ../samples/dcn/dcn.json ./dataset_dir 434428 1
```

### 4. Train an example DCN model ###
```shell
cd /hugectr/build
bin/huge_ctr --train ../samples/dcn/dcn.json
```
The other sample models and their end-to-end instructions are available inside [this directory](/samples).

## Build Options ##
### Use Docker Container ###
You can choose to use Docker to simplify the environment setting up.
Mare sure that you have installed [**Nvidia Docker**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) .

To build a docker image of **development environment** from the corresponding Dockerfile, run the command below.
It will install the libraries and tools required to use HugeCTR.
HugeCTR build itself must be done by yourself.
```shell
$ docker build -t hugectr:devel -f ./tools/dockerfiles/dev.a100.Dockerfile .
```
Run with interaction mode (mount the home directory of repo into container for easy development and try):
```shell
$ docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/hugectr -w /hugectr hugectr:devel bash
```

To build a docker image of **production environment**, run the command below.
In addition to resolving dependencies, it will build and install HugeCTR to `/usr/local/hugectr`.
Note that `SM` (the target GPU architecture list) and `NCCL_A2A` (use NCCL ALL-to-ALL or not) are also specified.
You can change them according to your environment.
```shell
$ docker build --build-arg SM="70;75;80" \
               --build-arg NCCL_A2A=on \
               -t hugectr:build \
               -f ./tools/dockerfiles/build.Dockerfile .
```

### Build with Release ###
Compute Capability can be specified by `-DSM=[Compute Compatibilities]`, which is SM70 by default (NVIDIA V100). It is also possible to set multiple Compute Capabilities, e.g., `-DSM=70` for NVIDIA V100 and `-DSM="70;75"` for both NVIDIA V100 and NVIDIA T4.
```shell
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSM=70 .. # Target is NVIDIA V100
$ make -j
```

### Build with Debug ###
If the build type is `Debug`, HugeCTR will print more verbose logs and execute GPU tasks in a synchronous manner.
The other options remain the same as `Release` build.
```shell
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DSM=70 .. # Target is NVIDIA V100
$ make -j
```

### Build with Validation Mode ###
This mode is designed for framework validation. In this mode loss of training will be shown as the average of `eval_batches` results. Only one thread and chunk will be used in DataReader. Performance will be lower than turning off.
```shell
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DVAL_MODE=ON ..
$ make -j
```

### Build with Multi-Nodes Training Supported ###
To run with multi-nodes please build in this way and run HugeCTR with `mpirun`. For more details please refer to `samples/dcn2nodes`
```shell
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DENABLE_MULTINODES=ON ..
$ make -j
```

### Build with NCCL All2All Supported ###
The default collection communication library used in LocalizedSlotSparseEmbedding is [Gossip](https://github.com/Funatiq/gossip). [NCCL all2all](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/tree/p2p) is also supported in HugeCTR. If you want to run with NCCL all2all, please turn on the NCCL_A2A switch in cmake. 
```shell
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DNCCL_A2A=ON ..
$ make -j
```

## Synthetic Data Generation and Benchmark ##
For quick benchmarking and research use, you can generate a synthetic dataset like below. Without any additional modification to JSON file. Both [**Norm** format](#norm) (with Header) and [**Raw** format](#raw) (without Header) dataset can be generated with `data_generator`.
- For `Norm` format: <br>
```bash
$ ./data_generator your_config.json data_folder vocabulary_size max_nnz (num_files) (num_samples_per_file)
$ ./huge_ctr --train your_config.json
```
- For `Raw` format: <br>
```bash
$ ./data_generator your_config.json
$ ./huge_ctr --train your_config.json
```

Parameters:
+ `data_folder`: Directory where the generated dataset is stored.
+ `vocabulary_size`: Total vocabulary size of your target dataset, which cannot be exceed `max_vocabulary_size_per_gpu` **x** the number of active GPUs. 
+ `max_nnz`: You can use this parameter to simulate one-/multi-hot encodings. If you just want to use the one-hot encoding, set this parameter to 1. Otherwise, [1, max_nnz] values will be generated for each slot. **Note** that `max_nnz * slot_num` must be less than `max_feature_num_per_sample` in the data layer of the used JSON config file.
+ `num_files`: Number of data file will be generated (optional)
+ `num_samples_per_file`: Number of samples per file (optional)

## File Format ##
In total, there are three types of files used in HugeCTR training: a configuration file, model file and dataset.

### Configuration File ###
Configuration file must be in a json format, e.g., [simple_sparse_embedding_fp32.json](test/utest/simple_sparse_embedding_fp32.json)

There are three main JSON objects in a configuration file: "solver", "optimizer", and "layers". They can be specified in any order.
* solver: the active GPU list, batchsize, model_file, etc are specified.
* optimizer: The type of optimizer and its hyperparameters are specified.
* layers: training/evaluation data (and their paths), embeddings and dense layers are specified. Note that embeddings must precede the dense layers.

### Model File ###
Model file is a binary file that will be loaded to initialize weights.
In that file, the weights are stored in the same order with the layers in the configuration file. 

We provide a tutorial on [**how to dump a model to TensorFlow**](./tutorial/dump_to_tf/readMe.md). You can find more details on `Model file and it format` there.

### Data Set ###
Two format of data set are supported in HugeCTR:
#### Norm ####
Norm format consists of a collection of data files and a file list.

The first line of a file list is the number of data files in the dataset.
It is followed by the paths to those files.
```shell
$ cat simple_sparse_embedding_file_list.txt
10
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding0.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding1.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding2.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding3.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding4.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding5.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding6.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding7.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding8.data
./simple_sparse_embedding/simple_sparse_embedding9.data
```

A data file (binary) consists of a header and actual tabular data.

Header Definition:
```c
typedef struct DataSetHeader_ {
  long long error_check;        // 0: no error check; 1: check_num
  long long number_of_records;  // the number of samples in this data file
  long long label_dim;          // dimension of label
  long long dense_dim;          // dimension of dense feature
  long long slot_num;           // slot_num for each embedding
  long long reserved[3];        // reserved for future use
} DataSetHeader;

```

Data Definition (each sample):
```c
typedef struct Data_{
  int length;                   // bytes in this sample (optional: only in check_sum mode )
  float label[label_dim];       
  float dense[dense_dim];
  Slot slots[slot_num];          
  char checkbits;                // checkbit for this sample (optional: only in checksum mode)
} Data;

typedef struct Slot_{
  int nnz;
  unsigned int*  keys; // changeable to `long long` with `"input_key_type"` in `solver` object of JSON config file.
} Slot;
```

#### RAW ####
RAW format is introduced in HugeCTR v2.2

Different to `Norm` format, The training Data in `RAW` format is all in one binary file and in int32, no matter Label / Dense Feature / Category Features.

The number of Samples / Dense feature / Category feature / label dimension are all declared in the configure json file.

Note that only one-hot data is accepted with this format.

Data Definition (each sample):
```c
typedef struct Data_{
  int label[label_dim];       
  int dense[dense_dim];
  int category[sparse_dim];
} Data;
```

## Coding Style and Refactor ##
Default coding style follows Google C++ coding style [(link)](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
This project also uses `Clang-Format`[(link)](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to help developers to fix style issue, such as indent, number of spaces to tab, etc.
The Clang-Format is a tool that can auto-refactor source code.
Use following instructions to install and enable Clang-Format:
### Install ###
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install clang-format
```
### Run ###
```shell
# First, configure Cmake as usual 
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCLANGFORMAT=ON ..
# Second, run Clang-Format
$ cmake --build . --target clangformat
# Third, check what Clang-Format did modify
$ git status
# or
$ git diff
```

## Document Generation ##
Doxygen is supported in HugeCTR and by default an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) can be generated within `docs/`.
### Install ###
[Download doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
### Generation ###
Within project `home` directory
```shell
$ doxygen
```
