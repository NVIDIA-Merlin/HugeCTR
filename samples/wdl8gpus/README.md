# Multi-GPU WDL CTR SAMPLE #
The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate how to build and train a [Wide & Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792) with HugeCTR on a 8-GPU machine, such as DGX-1.

## Set Up the HugeCTR Docker Environment ##
You can set up the HugeCTR Docker environment by doing one of the following:
- [Pull the NGC Docker](#pull-the-ngc-docker)
- [Build the HugeCTR Docker Container on Your Own](#build-the-hugectr-docker-container-on-your-own)

### Pull the NGC Docker ###
HugeCTR is available as buildable source code, but the easiest way to install and run HugeCTR is to pull the pre-built Docker image, which is available on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC). This method provides a self-contained, isolated, and reproducible environment for repetitive experiments.

1. Pull the HugeCTR NGC Docker by running the following command:
   ```bash
   $ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-training:0.5
   ```
2. Launch the container in interactive mode with the HugeCTR root directory mounted into the container by running the following command:
   ```bash
   $ docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/hugectr -w /hugectr nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-training:0.5
   ```
3. Activate the merlin conda environment by running the following command:  
   ```shell.
   source activate merlin
   ```  

### Build the Docker Container on Your Own ####
If you want to build the HugeCTR Docker container on your own, please refer to [Build HugeCTR Docker Containers](../../tools/dockerfiles#build-container-for-model-training) and [Use the Docker Container](../docs/mainpage.md#use-docker-container).

You should make sure that HugeCTR is built and installed in `/usr/local/hugectr` within the Docker container. You can launch the container in interactive mode in the same manner as shown above.

## Download the Dataset ##
Go [here](https://ailab.criteo.com/download-criteo-1tb-click-logs-dataset/) and download one of the dataset files into the "${project_root}/tools" directory.

As an alternative, you can run the following command:
```
$ cd ${project_root}/tools
$ wget http://azuremlsampleexperiments.blob.core.windows.net/criteo/day_1.gz
```

**NOTE**: Replace `1` with a value from [0, 23] to use a different day.

During preprocessing, the amount of data, which is used to speed up the preprocessing, fill missing values, and remove the feature values that are considered rare, is further reduced.

## Preprocess the Dataset ##
When running this sample, the [Criteo 1TB Click Logs dataset](https://ailab.criteo.com/download-criteo-1tb-click-logs-dataset/) is used. The dataset contains 24 files in which each file corresponds to one day of data. To reduce preprocessing time, only one file is used. Each sample consists of a label (0 if the ad wasn't clicked and 1 if the ad was clicked) and 39 features (13 integer features and 26 categorical features). The dataset is also missing numerous values across the feature columns, which should be preprocessed accordingly.

You can preprocess the dataset through one of the following methods:
- [Pandas](#preprocess-the-dataset-through-pandas)
- [NVTabular](#preprocess-the-dataset-through-nvtabular)

### Preprocess the Dataset Through Pandas ###
To preprocess the dataset through Pandas, run the following command:
```shell
$ bash preprocess.sh 1 criteo_data pandas 1 1
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES**: 
- The first argument represents the dataset postfix. For instance, if `day_1` is used, the postfix is `1`.
- The second argument, `criteo_data`, is where the preprocessed data is stored. You may want to change it in cases where multiple datasets are generated concurrently. If you change it, `source` and `eval_source` in your JSON configuration file must be changed as well.
- The fourth argument (the one after `pandas`) represents if the normalization is applied to dense features (1=ON, 0=OFF).
- The last argument determines whether the feature crossing should be applied (1=ON, 0=OFF).

### Preprocess the Dataset Through NVTabular ###
HugeCTR supports data processing through NVTabular. Make sure that the NVTabular docker environment has been set up successfully. For more information, see [NVTAbular github](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular). Ensure that you're using the latest version of NVTabular and mount the HugeCTR ${project_root} volume into the NVTabular Docker.

1. Run the NVTabular Docker and execute the following preprocessing commands:
   ```shell
   $ bash preprocess.sh 1 criteo_data nvt 1 0 1 # parquet output
   ```

   ```shell
   $ bash preprocess.sh 1 criteo_data nvt 0 0 1 # nvt binary output
   ```
2. Exit from the NVTabular Docker environment and launch the HugeCTR Docker in interactive mode with the HugeCTR root directory mounted into the  
   container.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**: 
- The first and second arguments are the same as Pandas's as shown above.
- If you want to generate binary data using the `Norm` data format instead of the `Parquet` data format, set the fourth argument (the one after `nvt`) to `0`. Generating binary data using the `Norm` data format can take much longer than it does when using the `Parquet` data format because of the additional conversion process. Use the NVTabular binary mode if you encounter an issue with Pandas mode.
- The last argument determines whether the feature crossing should be applied (1=ON, 0=OFF).

## Train with HugeCTR ##

1. Generate a plan file.
   To exploit Gossip library for inter-GPU communication, a plan file must be generated. If you change the number of GPUs in the JSON configuration 
   file (`"gpu"` in `"solver"`), it must be regenerated as follows:
   ```shell
   $ export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID
   $ python3 plan_generation_no_mpi/plan_generator_no_mpi.py ../samples/wdl8gpus/wdl8gpu.json
   ```
2. Run huge_ctr by running the following command:
   ```shell
   $ huge_ctr --train ../samples/wdl8gpus/wdl8gpu.json
   ```
