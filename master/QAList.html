<h2>1. Who are the target users of HugeCTR?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-are-the-target-users-of-hugectr" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>We are trying to provide a recommender specific framework to users from various industries, who need high-efficient solutions for their online/offline CTR training.
HugeCTR is also a reference design for framework developers who want to port their CPU solutions to GPU or optimize their current GPU solutions.</p>

<h2>2. Which models can be supported in HugeCTR?<a class="headerlink" href="#which-models-can-be-supported-in-hugectr" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>HugeCTR v2.2 supports DNN, WDL, DCN, DeepFM, DLRM and their variants, which are widely used in industrial recommender systems.
Refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HugeCTR/tree/master/samples">samples</a> directory in the HugeCTR repository on GitHub to try them with HugeCTR.
HugeCTR’s expressiveness is not confined to the aforementioned models.
You can construct your own models by combining the layers supported by HugeCTR.</p>

<h2>3. Does HugeCTR support TensorFlow?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-hugectr-support-tensorflow" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>HugeCTR v2.2 has no TF interface yet, but a HugeCTR Trained model is compatible with TensorFlow.
We recommend that you export a trained model to TensorFlow for inference by following the instructions in dump_to_tf tutorial that is in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HugeCTR/tree/master/tutorial">tutorial</a> directory of the HugeCTR repository on GitHub.</p>

<h2>4. Does HugeCTR support multiple nodes CTR training?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-hugectr-support-multiple-nodes-ctr-training" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Yes. HugeCTR supports single-GPU, multi-GPU and multi-node training. Check out samples/dcn2node for more details.</p>

<p>Embedding table in HugeCTR is model-parallel stored across GPUs and nodes.  So if you have a very large embedding table, just use as many GPUs as you need to store it. That’s why we have the name “HugeCTR”. Suppose you have 1TB embedding table and 16xV100-32GB in a GPU server node, you can take 2 nodes for such a case.</p>

<h2>8. Can HugeCTR run without InfiniBand?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-hugectr-run-without-infiniband" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>For multi-node training, InfiniBand is recommended but not required. You can use any solution with UCX support.
However, InfiniBand with GPU RDMA support will maximize performance of inter-node transactions.</p>

<p>Yes, hashtable based embedding in HugeCTR supports dynamic insertion, which is designed for stream training. New features can be added into embedding in runtime.
HugeCTR also supports data check. Error data will be skipped in training.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-slot-in-hugectr">
<h2>14. What is a “slot” in HugeCTR?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-slot-in-hugectr" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In HugeCTR, a slot is a feature field or table.
The features in a slot can be one-hot or multi-hot.
The number of features in different slots can be various.
You can specify the number of slots (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slot_num</span></code>) in the data layer of your configuration file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-differences-between-localizedslotembedding-and-distributedslotembedding">
<h2>15. What are the differences between LocalizedSlotEmbedding and DistributedSlotEmbedding?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-differences-between-localizedslotembedding-and-distributedslotembedding" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are two sub-classes of Embedding layer, LocalizedSlotEmbedding and DistributedSlotEmbedding.
They are distinguished by different methods of distributing embedding tables on multiple GPUs as model parallelism.
For LocalizedSlotEmbedding, the features in the same slot will be stored in one GPU (that is why we call it “localized slot”), and different slots may be stored in different GPUs according to the index number of the slot.
For DistributedSlotEmbedding, all the features are distributed to different GPUs according to the index number of the feature, regardless of the index number of the slot.
That means the features in the same slot may be stored in different GPUs (that is why we call it “distributed slot”).</p>
<p>Thus LocalizedSlotEmbedding is optimized for the case each embedding is smaller than the memory size of GPU. As local reduction per slot is used in LocalizedSlotEmbedding and no global reduce between GPUs, the overall data transaction in Embedding is much less than DistributedSlotEmbedding. DistributedSlotEmbedding is made for the case some of the embeddings are larger than the memory size of GPU. As global reduction is required. DistributedSlotEmbedding has much more memory trasactions between GPUs.</p>

<p>After embedding lookup, the embedding features in one slot need to be combined (or reduced) into one embedding vector.
There are 2 steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>local reduction in single GPU in forward kernel function;</p></li>
<li><p>global reduction across multi-node / multi-gpu by collective communications libraries such as NCCL.</p></li>

<p>Yes. The training model in HugeCTR is saved in raw format, and you can import it to other frameworks by writing some scripts.
We provide a tutorial to demonstrate how to import the HugeCTR trained model to TensorFlow.

<p>As embeddings are model-parallel in HugeCTR,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workspace_size_per_gpu_in_mb</span></code> is a reference number for HugeCTR to allocate GPU memory accordingly and not necessarily the exact number of features in your dataset.
The value to set depends on the vocabulary size per GPU, the embedding vector size, and the optimizer type.
Refer to the embedding workspace calculator in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HugeCTR/tree/master/tools">tools</a> directory of the HugeCTR repository on GitHub.
Use the calculator to calculate the vocabulary size per GPU and workspace_size per GPU for different embedding types, embedding vector size, and optimizer type.</p>
<p>In practice, we usually set the values larger than the real size because of the non-uniform distribution of the keys.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slot_size_array</span></code> argument has 2 usages.
You can use it as a replacement for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workspace_size_per_gpu_in_mb</span></code> to avoid wasting memory that is caused by imbalanced vocabulary size.
You can also use it as a reference to add an offset for keys in a different slot.</p>
<p>When you specify <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slot_size_array</span></code> to avoid wasting memory, set each value in the array to the maximum key value in each slot.
Refer to the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(slot\_size\_array[k] = \max\limits_i slot^k_i + 1\)</span></p>
<p>Refer to the following list for information about the relation between embedding type, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workspace_size_per_gpu_in_mb</span></code> value, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slot_size_array</span></code> value:</p>

The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slot_size_array</span></code> argument can help avoid wasting memory that is caused by an imbalanced vocabulary size.
As an alternative, you can specify <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workspace_size_per_gpu_in_mb</span></code> so that each GPU allocates the same amount of memory for the embedding table usage.
If you specify both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slot_size_array</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workspace_size_per_gpu_in_mb</span></code>, HugeCTR uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slot_size_array</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LocalizedSlotSparseEmbeddingHash</span></code>.</p></li>

<h2>25. Is nvlink required in HugeCTR?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-nvlink-required-in-hugectr" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>GPU with nvlink is not required, but recommended because the performance of CTR training highly relies on the performance of inter-GPUs communication. GPU servers with PCIE connections are also supported.</p>

<h2>26. Is DGX the only GPU server that is required in HugeCTR?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-dgx-the-only-gpu-server-that-is-required-in-hugectr" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>DGX is not required, but recommended, because the performance of CTR training highly relies on the performance of inter-GPUs transactions. DGX has NVLink and NVSwitch inside, so that you can expect 150GB/s per direction per GPU. It’s 9.3x to PCI-E 3.0.</p>

<h2>27. Can HugeCTR run without InfiniBand?<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>For multi-node training, InfiniBand is recommended but not required. You can use any solution with UCX support. InfiniBand with GPU RDMA support will maximize performance of inter-node transactions.</p>

<h2>28. Does HugeCTR support loading pretrained embeddings in other formats?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-hugectr-support-loading-pretrained-embeddings-in-other-formats" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>You can convert the pretrained embeddings to the HugeCTR sparse models and then load them to facilitate the training process. You can refer to <a class="reference internal" href="api/python_interface.html#save-params-to-files-method"><span class="std std-doc">save_params_to_files</span></a> to get familiar with the HugeCTR sparse model format. We demonstrate the usage in 3.4 Load Pre-trained Embeddings of <a class="reference internal" href="notebooks/hugectr_criteo.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">hugectr_criteo.ipynb</span></a>.</p>

<h2>29. How to construct the model graph with branch topology in HugeCTR?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-construct-the-model-graph-with-branch-topology-in-hugectr" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The branch topology is inherently supported by HugeCTR model graph, and extra layers are abstracted away in HugeCTR Python Interface.
Refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="api/hugectr_layer_book.html#slice-layer"><span class="std std-doc">Slice Layer</span></a> for information about model graphs with branches and sample code.</p>

<h2>30. What is the good practice of configuring the embedding vector size?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-good-practice-of-configuring-the-embedding-vector-size" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The embedding vector size is related to the size of Cooperative Thread Array (CTA) for HugeCTR kernel launching, so first and foremost it should not exceed the maximum number of threads per block. It would be better that it is configured to a multiple of the warp size for the sake of occupancy. Still, you can set the embedding vector size freely according to the specific model architecture as long as it complies with the limit.</p>

<p>HugeCTR uses NCCL to share data between ranks, and NCCL may requires shared memory for IPC and pinned (page-locked) system memory resources. The bus error is related to the limited resources and can be resolved by issuing the following options in the docker run command.</p>
