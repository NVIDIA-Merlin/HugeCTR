# Hierarchical Parameter Server Notebooks #
This directory contains a set of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use HPS in TensorFlow.

## Quickstart

The simplest way to run a one of our notebooks is with a Docker container.
A container provides a self-contained, isolated, and reproducible environment for repetitive experiments.
Docker images are available from the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC).
If you prefer to build the HugeCTR Docker image on your own, refer to [Set Up the Development Environment With Merlin Containers](https://nvidia-merlin.github.io/HugeCTR/master/hugectr_contributor_guide.html#set-up-the-development-environment-with-merlin-containers).

### Pull the NGC Docker

Pull the container using the following command:

```shell
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-tensorflow:22.08
```

### Clone the HugeCTR Repository

Use the following command to clone the HugeCTR repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/HugeCTR
```

### Start the Jupyter Notebook
1. Launch the container in interactive mode (mount the HugeCTR root directory into the container for your convenience) by running this command:

   ```shell
   docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -it --cap-add SYS_NICE -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/hugectr -w /hugectr -p 8888:8888 nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-tensorflow:22.08
   ```

2. Start Jupyter using these commands: 

   ```shell
   cd /hugectr/hierarchical_parameter_server/notebooks
   jupyter-notebook --allow-root --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --NotebookApp.token='hugectr'
   ```

3. Connect to your host machine using the 8888 port by accessing its IP address or name from your web browser: `http://[host machine]:8888`

   Use the token available from the output by running the command above to log in. For example:

   `http://[host machine]:8888/?token=aae96ae9387cd28151868fee318c3b3581a2d794f3b25c6b`


## Notebook List

Here's a list of notebooks that you can run:
- [hierarchical_parameter_server_demo.ipynb](hierarchical_parameter_server_demo.ipynb): Demonstrates how to train with native TF layers and make inference with HPS.

- [hps_multi_table_sparse_input_demo.ipynb](hps_multi_table_sparse_input_demo.ipynb): Demonstrates how to train with native TF layers and make inference with HPS when there are multiple embedding tables and the input keys are in the form of sparse tensor. 

- [hps_pretrained_model_training_demo.ipynb](hps_pretrained_model_training_demo.ipynb): Demonstrates how to leverage the HPS to load the pre-trained embedding tables for new training tasks and how to use HPS with TensorFlow Mirrored Strategy.

- [sok_to_hps_dlrm_demo.ipynb](sok_to_hps_dlrm_demo.ipynb): Demonstrates how to train a DLRM model with [SparseOperationKit (SOK)](https://nvidia-merlin.github.io/HugeCTR/sparse_operation_kit/master/index.html) and then make inference with HPS.

## System Specifications
The specifications of the system on which each notebook can run successfully are summarized in the table. The notebooks are verified on the system below but it does not mean the minimum requirements.
