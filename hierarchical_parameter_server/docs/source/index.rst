Hierarchical Parameter Server
=============================

Hierarchical Parameter Server (HPS) is a distributed recommendation inference framework, 
which combines a high-performance GPU embedding cache with an hierarchical storage architecture, 
to realize low-latency retrieval of embeddings for inference tasks. 
It is provided as a Python toolkit and can be easily integrated into the TensorFlow (TF) model graph.
