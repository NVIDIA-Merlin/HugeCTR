# Release Notes

## What's New in Version 3.0.1

+ **New DLRM Inference Benchmark**: We've added two detailed Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to train, deploy, and benchmark the performance of a deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) with HugeCTR. For more information, see our [HugeCTR Inference Notebooks](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/hugectr_backend/tree/v3.0.1-integration/samples/dlrm).

+ **FP16 Optimization**: We've optimized the DotProduct, ELU, and Sigmoid layers based on `__half2` vectorized loads and stores, improving their device memory bandwidth utilization. MultiCross, FmOrder2, ReduceSum, and Multiply are the only layers that still need to be optimized for FP16.

+ **Synthetic Data Generator Enhancement**: We've enhanced our synthetic data generator so that it can generate uniformly distributed datasets, as well as power-law based datasets. You can now specify the `vocabulary_size` and `max_nnz` per categorical feature instead of across all categorial features. For more information, see our [user guide](docs/hugectr_user_guide.md#generating-synthetic-data-and-benchmarks).

+ **Reduced Memory Allocation for Trained Model Exportation**: To prevent the "Out of Memory" error message from displaying when exporting a trained model, which may include a very large embedding table, the amount of memory allocated by the related functions has been significantly reduced.

+ **Dropout Layer Enhancement**: We've made the Dropout layer compatible with CUDA Graph. The Dropout layer is using cuDNN by default so that it can be used with CUDA Graph.

## What’s New in Version 3.0

+ **Inference Support**: To streamline the recommender system workflow, we’ve implemented a custom HugeCTR backend on the [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server). The HugeCTR backend leverages the embedding cache and parameter server to efficiently manage embeddings of different sizes and models in a hierarchical manner. For additional information, see [our inference repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/hugectr_backend).

+ **New High-Level API**: You can now also construct and train your models using the Python interface with our new high-level API. See [our preview example code](samples/preview) to grasp how it works.

+ **[FP16 Support](hugectr_user_guide.md#mixed-precision-training) in More Layers**: All the layers except `MultiCross` support mixed precision mode. We’ve also optimized some of the FP16 layer implementations based on vectorized loads and stores.

+ **[Enhanced TensorFlow Embedding Plugin](notebooks/embedding_plugin.ipynb)**: Our embedding plugin now supports `LocalizedSlotSparseEmbeddingHash` mode. With this enhancement, the DNN model no longer needs to be split into two parts since it now connects with the embedding op through `MirroredStrategy` within the embedding layer.

+ **Extended Model Oversubscription**: We’ve extended the model oversubscription feature to support `LocalizedSlotSparseEmbeddingHash` and `LocalizedSlotSparseEmbeddingHashOneHot`.

+ **Epoch-Based Training Enhancement**: The `num_epochs` option in the **Solver** clause can now be used with the `Raw` dataset format.

+ **Deprecation of the `eval_batches` Parameter**: The `eval_batches` parameter has been deprecated and replaced with the `max_eval_batches` and `max_eval_samples` parameters. In epoch mode, these parameters control the maximum number of evaluations. An error message will appear when attempting to use the `eval_batches` parameter.

+ **`MultiplyLayer` Renamed**: To clarify what the `MultiplyLayer` does, it was renamed to `WeightMultiplyLayer`.

+ **Optimized Initialization Time**: HugeCTR’s initialization time, which includes the GEMM algorithm search and parameter initialization, was significantly reduced.

+ **Sample Enhancements**: Our samples now rely upon the [Criteo 1TB Click Logs dataset](https://ailab.criteo.com/download-criteo-1tb-click-logs-dataset/) instead of the Kaggle Display Advertising Challenge dataset. Our preprocessing scripts (Perl, Pandas, and NVTabular) have also been unified and simplified.

+ **Configurable DataReader Worker**: You can now specify the number of data reader workers, which run in parallel, with the `num_workers` parameter. Its default value is 12. However, if you are using the Parquet data reader, you can't configure the `num_workers` parameter since it always corresponds to the number of active GPUs.

## What's New in Version 2.3

+ **New Python Interface**: To enhance the interoperability with [NVTabular](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular) and other Python-based libraries, we're introducing a new Python interface for HugeCTR.

+ **HugeCTR Embedding with Tensorflow**: To help users easily integrate HugeCTR’s optimized embedding into their Tensorflow workflow, we now offer the HugeCTR embedding layer as a Tensorflow plugin. To better understand how to intall, use, and verify it, see our [Jupyter notebook tutorial](../notebooks/embedding_plugin.ipynb). It also demonstrates how you can create a new Keras layer, `EmbeddingLayer`, based on the [`hugectr.py`](../tools/embedding_plugin/python) helper code that we provide.

+ **Model Oversubscription**: To enable a model with large embedding tables that exceeds the single GPU's memory limit, we've added a new model oversubscription feature, giving you the ability to load a subset of an embedding table into the GPU in a coarse grained, on-demand manner during the training stage.

+ **TF32 Support**: We've added TensorFloat-32 (TF32), a new math mode and third-generation of Tensor Cores, support on Ampere. TF32 uses the same 10-bit mantissa as FP16 to ensure accuracy while providing the same range as FP32 by using an 8-bit exponent. Since TF32 is an internal data type that accelerates FP32 GEMM computations with tensor cores, you can simply turn it on with a newly added configuration option. For additional information, see [Solver](docs/hugectr_user_guide.md#solver).

+ **Enhanced AUC Implementation**: To enhance the performance of our AUC computation on multi-node environments, we've redesigned our AUC implementation to improve how the computational load gets distributed across nodes.

+ **Epoch-Based Training**: In addition to the `max_iter` parameter, you can now set the `num_epochs` parameter in the **Solver** clause within the configuration file. This mode can only currently be used with `Norm` dataset formats and their corresponding file lists. All dataset formats will be supported in the future.

+ **New Multi-Node Training Tutorial**: To better support multi-node training use cases, we've added a new [a step-by-step tutorial](../tutorial/multinode-training).

+ **Power Law Distribution Support with Data Generator**: Because of the increased need for generating a random dataset whose categorical features follows the power-law distribution, we've revised our data generation tool to support this use case. For additional information, refer to the `--long-tail` description [here](../docs/hugectr_user_guide.md#Generating Synthetic Data and Benchmarks).

+ **Multi-GPU Preprocessing Script for Criteo Samples**: Multiple GPUs can now be used when preparing the dataset for our [samples](../samples). For additional information, see how [preprocess_nvt.py](../tools/criteo_script/preprocess_nvt.py) is used to preprocess the Criteo dataset for DCN, DeepFM, and W&D samples.

## Known Issues
+ Since the automatic plan file generator isn't able to handle systems that contain one GPU, you must manually create a JSON plan file with the following parameters and rename it using the name listed in the HugeCTR configuration file: `{"type": "all2all", "num_gpus": 1, "main_gpu": 0, "num_steps": 1, "num_chunks": 1, "plan": [[0, 0]], and "chunks": [1]}`.

+ If using a system that contains two GPUs with two NVLink connections, the auto plan file generator will print the following warning message: `RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in true_divide`. This is an erroneous warning message and should be ignored.

+ The current plan file generator doesn't support a system where the NVSwitch or a full peer-to-peer connection between all nodes is unavailable.

+ Users need to set an `export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID` environment variable to ensure that the CUDA runtime and driver have a consistent GPU numbering.

+ `LocalizedSlotSparseEmbeddingOneHot` only supports a single-node machine where all the GPUs are fully connected such as NVSwitch.

+ HugeCTR version 3.0 crashes when running the DLRM sample on DGX2 due to a CUDA Graph issue. To run the sample on DGX2, disable the CUDA Graph by setting the `cuda_graph` parameter to false even if it degrades the performance a bit. This issue doesn't exist when using the DGX A100.

+ The HugeCTR embedding TensorFlow plugin only works with single-node machines.

+ The HugeCTR embedding TensorFlow plugin assumes that the input keys are in `int64` and its output is in `float`.

+ If the number of samples in a dataset is not divisible by the batch size when in epoch mode and using the `num_epochs` instead of `max_iter`, a few remaining samples are truncated. If the training dataset is large enough, its impact can be negligible. If you want to minimize the wasted batches, try adjusting the number of data reader workers. For example, using a file list source, set the `num_workers` parameter to an advisor based on the number of data files in the file list.

+ MultiCross layer doesn't support mixed precision mode yet.
